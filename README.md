### [H](https://github.com/Raviteja-Tammana)ello! My name is ‚ú® Ravi Tammana ‚ú®, and I'm a 3rd Year Computer Science and Engineering Student @ UC Irvine specializing in Full-Stack Development üï∏Ô∏è.

##### [I](https://github.com/Raviteja-Tammana) am a man with a lot of technical passions. Up to date, I have worked with Modeling Software, Circuit Design, Computer Architecture, Robotics, Full-Stack Development, and Data Analytics. As you can probably tell, my greatest passion is to learn new things, and delve into distinct fields. However, I have had the most experience so far in the fields of Full-Stack Development and Data Analytics. Through multiple hackathons where I developed unique websites through collaboration with others and an internship under the California Department of Conservation as a Data Analyst, I've been able to largely develop my skills and knowledge in these two fields. Currently, I'm endeavoring to enhance my comprehension in these two areas through personal projects and design teams, and also in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning through professional certifications. Thanks for reading about my story, and make sure to check out my repository section to see some of the projects I have worked on so far! üñ•Ô∏è
