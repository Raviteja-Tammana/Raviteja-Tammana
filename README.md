### Hello! My name is ✨ Ravi Tammana ✨, and I'm a 2nd Year Computer Engineering Student @ UC Irvine specializing in Full-Stack Development 🕸️ and Data Analytics 🔢. 

##### I'm a man with a lot of technical passions. Up to date, I have worked with Modelling Software, Circuit Design, Computer Architecture, Robotics, Full-Stack Development, and Data Analytics. As you can probably tell, my greatest passion is to learn new things, and delve into distinct fields. However, I have had the most experience so far in the fields of Full-Stack Development and Data Analytics. Through multiple hackathons where I developed unique websites through collaboration with others and an internship under the California Department of Conservation as a Data Analyst, I've been able to largely develop my skills and knowledge in these two fields. Currently, I'm endeavoring to enhance my comprehension in these two areas through online courses and personal projects, but my professional dream is to utilize what I learn in the field of Robotics, and hopefully innovate my own robot one day that changes the world. Thanks for reading about my story, and make sure to check out my repository section to see some of the projects I have worked on so far! 🖥️
