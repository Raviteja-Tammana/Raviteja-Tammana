### [H](https://github.com/Raviteja-Tammana)ello! My name is ✨ Ravi Tammana ✨, and I'm a 4th Year Computer Science & Engineering Student @ UC Irvine specializing in Full-Stack Development 🕸️.

##### [I](https://github.com/Raviteja-Tammana) am a man with a lot of technical passions. Up to date, I have worked with Modeling Software, Circuit Design, Computer Architecture, Robotics, Full-Stack Development, Generative AI, Machine Learning, and Data Analytics. As you can probably tell, my greatest passion is to learn new things, and delve into distinct fields. However, I have had the most experience so far in the fields of Full-Stack Development, Generative AI/Machine Learning, and Data Analytics. Through various collegiate hackathons, a Software Engineering internship, and a Generative AI externship, I've been able to significantly develop my skills and knowledge in these three fields. Currently, I am endeavoring to enhance my comprehension in these three areas through personal projects, student engineering design teams, and professional certifications. My current objective for the future is to acquire a role as a Software Engineer to gain hands-on industry experience with Software Engineering tools and principles. Thanks for reading about my story, and make sure to check out my repository section to see some of the projects I have worked on so far! 🖥️
